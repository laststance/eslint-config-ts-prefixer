# ESLint v9 Migration Analysis

This document analyzes the results of running the ESLint v9 migration tool on the eslint-config-ts-prefixer package.

## Migration Tool Execution

The migration tool was executed using the following command:

```bash
npx @eslint/migrate-config index.cjs
```

This generated a new configuration file `index.mjs` in the flat config format.

## Migration Results

### Automatically Migrated Components

The migration tool successfully converted the following components from the original configuration:

1. **Rules Configuration**: All ESLint rules were successfully migrated with their options intact.
2. **Parser Configuration**: The TypeScript parser configuration was migrated.
3. **Plugin Integration**: The plugins (@typescript-eslint, import, prettier) were properly imported and configured.
4. **Environment Settings**: Browser, Node, and Jest environments were migrated as globals.
5. **Overrides**: The file-specific overrides were migrated to a separate configuration object in the array.
6. **Settings**: Import resolver settings were preserved.

### Required Dependencies

The migration tool indicated that the following packages need to be installed:

```bash
npm install @eslint/compat globals @eslint/js @eslint/eslintrc -D
```

These packages are required for the new flat config format to work properly.

### Migration Messages

The tool generated the following message during migration:

- "The 'node' environment is used, so switching sourceType to 'commonjs'."

## Gaps Requiring Manual Intervention

1. **Module System**: The generated configuration uses ESM (index.mjs) but sets `sourceType: "commonjs"`. This might need adjustment based on the project's module system.

2. **ecmaVersion Setting**: The migration set `ecmaVersion: 5` which is likely too low for modern JavaScript. The original configuration used `es2023` environment, so this should be updated to match.

3. **Template Configuration Files**: The migration tool only processed the main configuration file. The template files in `template/config/` directory need to be manually migrated. A sample migration of the template `.eslintrc.cjs` to `eslint.config.js` has been created.

4. **Package Exports**: The package.json needs to be updated to export both the legacy and new configuration formats during the transition period.

5. **Documentation**: The README and other documentation need to be updated to reflect the new configuration format and usage instructions.

6. **Testing**: The regression tests need to be updated to test both the legacy and new configuration formats.

## Changes Applied by the Migration Tool

### Structure Changes

1. **Format Change**: Converted from CommonJS to ESM module format.
2. **Configuration Array**: Uses a flat array of configuration objects instead of a nested structure.
3. **Plugin Loading**: Explicitly imports and registers plugins instead of using string references.

### API Changes

1. **Globals**: Uses explicit globals import instead of env property.
2. **Language Options**: Consolidates parser, parserOptions, and env settings under languageOptions.
3. **Linter Options**: Moves reportUnusedDisableDirectives to linterOptions.
4. **Files Pattern**: Uses files array instead of overrides.files for pattern matching.

## Next Steps

1. Install required dependencies
2. Address the gaps requiring manual intervention
3. Test the migrated configuration
4. Update documentation
5. Create a transition plan for users of the package
